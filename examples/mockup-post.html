                            Flamenco is a form of Spanish folk music and dance from the region of Andalusia in southern Spain. It includes cante (singing), toque (guitar playing), baile (dance) and palmas (handclaps). First mentioned in literature in 1774, the genre grew out of Andalusian and Romani music and dance styles. Flamenco is often associated with the Romani people of Spain (Gitanos) and a number of famous flamenco artists are of this ethnicity. While flamenco originally crystalized among gypsies in the 18th century, some authors believe that modern flamenco mostly emerged out of late nineteenth-century romanticism.

                        <h3>Etymology</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are many assertions as to the use of the name flamenco as a musical term (summarized below) but no solid evidence for any of them. The word was not recorded as a musical and dance term until the late 18th century.

                            Outside the musical context, the Spanish word flamenco can mean "flamingo" - referring to the bird, but originally meaning "flame-coloured" - but also "Flemish", i.e. someone or something related to Flanders. The (predominantly Flemish) courtiers of Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire (Carlos I of Spain) were known for their colourful dresses and florid and exaggerated displays of courtesy, but also for their generally arrogant and boisterous behaviour. While no direct connection can be shown, the word flamenco came to be used for arrogant or flamboyant behaviour in general, which then may have come to be applied to the Gitano players and performers.

                        <p>
                            Another widely held theory, proposed by Andalusian historian Blas Infante in his book "Or√≠genes de lo Flamenco y Secreto del Cante Jondo", suggests that the word flamenco comes from the Hispano-Arabic word fellah mengu, meaning "expelled peasant", or "flahencon" meaning "collection of songs". Infante argued that the term referred to the ethnic Andalusians of Muslim faith, the Moriscos, who in order to avoid forced exile and religious persecution would have joined Roma newcomers.
